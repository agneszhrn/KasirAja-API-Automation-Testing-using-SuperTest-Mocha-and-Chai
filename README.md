SuperTest, Mocha and Chai are testing tools and assertion libraries for JavaScript that I use to create automated API tests for KasirAja. To get started with testing, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo to your computer.
2. Navigate to the `mocha-chai-api-testing` directory.
3. Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Run the command `npm test` to run all tests.
